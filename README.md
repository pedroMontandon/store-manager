Great job on creating your store manager app! Here's an improved version of your text:

In this project, I developed a simple store manager app that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database. The app was built using Node.js for the backend code, Express.js to interact with the database, and MySQL for database management.

To ensure the reliability and functionality of the app, comprehensive tests were implemented, covering approximately 70% of the codebase.

For better organization and security, I adopted the MSC (Model-Service-Controller) architecture, which separates different components of the app and helps protect against potential attacks.

To run the app, simply enter "npm start" in your terminal. For interacting with the database, I recommend using Thunderclient. To run the tests, use the command "npm run test:mocha".

I'm open to any suggestions and tips to further improve the app.

Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!
